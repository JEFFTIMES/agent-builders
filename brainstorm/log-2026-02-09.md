let's drill down each step further before writing the level-1 workflow.


• Sounds good. Which step do you want to drill into first?

  1. Intake + Goal Framing
  2. System Design
  3. Execution Plan
  4. Build
  5. Quality Gate
  6. Review Gate
  7. Deploy + Observe
  8. Security Gate
  9. Documentation
  10. Meta‑Loop: Agent Creation


› let's start from the first one. please detail the input and output with examples.

Here’s Step 1: Intake + Goal Framing (Product Owner Agent) with detailed inputs/outputs and examples.

  Purpose
  Translate a vague goal into a precise, testable scope for the team.

  Inputs (what the Product Owner Agent asks for)

  1. Business goal (why this matters)
  2. Target users (who will use it)
  3. Success metrics (how we judge success)
  4. Constraints (time, budget, data, tooling)
  5. Risks/unknowns (what could derail)
  6. Non‑goals (what’s explicitly out of scope)

  Example Inputs

  - Business goal: “Create an agent that drafts client proposals in 15 minutes.”
  - Target users: “Sales reps in a B2B SaaS company.”
  - Success metrics: “Reduce proposal time by 60%, 80% acceptance rate of first draft.”
  - Constraints: “Must use existing CRM data, no external storage, 2‑week deadline.”
  - Risks/unknowns: “Proposal templates vary by industry.”
  - Non‑goals: “No automated pricing changes or contract signing.”

  Outputs (structured artifact passed to Step 2)

  1. Problem statement (1–2 sentences)
  2. Scope (in/out)
  3. Acceptance criteria (testable)
  4. Key assumptions
  5. Open questions
  6. Success metrics (finalized)


Example Output (Artifact)

  - Problem Statement: “Build an agent that generates first‑draft client proposals from CRM data and a short user
    prompt, reducing proposal creation time by 60%.”
  - Scope In:
      - Draft proposal structure
      - Pull CRM customer data
      - Insert pre‑approved product blurbs
  - Scope Out:
      - Final legal review
      - Pricing changes
      - Contract signing
  - Acceptance Criteria:
      - Draft generated in <15 minutes
      - Includes client name, industry, and 3 relevant case studies
      - 80% of drafts accepted with minimal edits
  - Assumptions:
      - CRM fields are complete and up‑to‑date
      - Proposal templates exist
  - Open Questions:
      - Which proposal sections are mandatory by industry?
      - How should the agent select case studies?
  - Success Metrics:
      - Time to first draft
      - Draft acceptance rate
      - Sales rep satisfaction score
