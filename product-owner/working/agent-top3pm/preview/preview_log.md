# Preview Conversation Log - agent-top3pm

- [2026-02-19 12:01:08 PST] HPO: "let's start a new project -- agent-top3pm"
- [2026-02-19 12:02:00 PST] HPO: "start preview"
- [2026-02-19 12:08:33 PST] Peter(PD): Compiled initial preview v0.1 from JD + Mantis/Teams/Jenkins/InfoSite assets; prepared workflow/apps/rules/handoff/problem hypotheses for HPO review.
- [2026-02-19 12:17:20 PST] HPO: Provided confirmed TOP3 operational workflow and role responsibilities across Mantis/Teams/Jenkins/Outlook/InfoSite/Phabricator.
- [2026-02-19 12:17:20 PST] Peter(PD): Updated preview workflow artifacts to v0.2 to align exactly with HPO-defined execution sequence.
- [2026-02-19 16:17:22 PST] Peter(PD): Summary of completed Preview work: (1) created v0.1 baseline artifacts for workflow/apps/business rules/handoffs/data model/problems/hypothesis and user-app interactions; (2) interpreted Phabricator task `T28209` linkage to Mantis `1229978`, branch `br_7-4_logging_rsso_acc_msgs`, build tags (`8923`/`8997`), validation bugs (`1241309/1241339/1241381/1253629`), and checklist evidence files; (3) updated workflow and app inventory to HPO-confirmed process in v0.2; (4) produced `workflow-v0.3.md` with explicit `Workflow Participators and Responsibilities` while keeping `Role Positioning by System`.
- [2026-02-19 18:33:13 PST] Peter(PD): Upgraded cross-app managed-object handoff from field-list format to ontology format in `x-app-mo-data-handoff-v0.3.md`, including entity/property definitions, typed relations, cardinality constraints, link keys, ontology handoff chain, and worked instance for TOP3 case `1229978`.
- [2026-02-19 18:36:10 PST] Peter(PD): Rewrote data model to ontology-aligned format in `data-model-top3-case-v0.2.md`, synchronized with `x-app-mo-data-handoff-v0.3.md` entities/relations/cardinality/link-key logic.
- [2026-02-19 21:13:36 PST] Peter(PD): Advanced branch data model to `data-model-top3-case-v0.3.md` with Jenkins branch-request properties (`GITLAB_TOP_LEVEL_GROUP`, `GITLAB_PROJECT`, `MAJOR_VERSION`, `MINOR_VERSION`, `NEW_BRANCH_NAME`, `BRANCH_POINT`, `BRANCH_TYPE`, `BRANCH_DESCRIPTION`, `FOR_CUSTOMER`) and role links/fields for `DEV_LEAD` and `PM_LEAD`.
- [2026-02-20 07:34:04 PST] Peter(PD): Advanced data model to `data-model-top3-case-v0.4.md` with event-based execution modeling: added `BranchRequest`, `BuildRequestPage`, `BuildRequest`, `BuildRun`; added human-action relations (`Person submitsBranchRequest`, `Person submitsBuildRequest`); and added both branch-build linkage forms (`Branch exposesBuildEntry BuildRequestPage` and `BuildRequest usesBranch Branch`).
- [2026-02-20 11:20:23 PST] Peter(PD): Updated `data-model-top3-case-v0.5.md` for `Top3Case` alignment with Mantis semantics (status/severity/category/ETA/customer/owners/branch/hardware/phase/closure), kept both owner snapshot properties and canonical owner relations, and introduced `ActionHistory` + `BugNote` entities with typed relations from `Top3Case`.
- [2026-02-20 13:58:07 PST] Peter(PD): Advanced data model to `data-model-top3-case-v0.6.md` with enriched `BugNote` extraction semantics: headline classification (`update/summary/release/other`), `#mantisId` mention extraction, mention snapshots to typed entities, phase-signal extraction, and provenance fields; added bugnote reference relations and `Top3Case.currentPhase` provenance fields (`currentPhaseSource`, `currentPhaseEvidenceNoteId`).
- [2026-02-20 14:04:32 PST] Peter(PD): Refined `Top3Case.caseSummary` semantics in `data-model-top3-case-v0.6.md` as PM-authored process summary (critical issues, obstacles, turning points, key persons/contributions), and clarified that release summary remains in `BugNote(headlineType=release)` with no standalone Top3Case release-summary property.
- [2026-02-20 14:06:32 PST] Peter(PD): Updated governance instructions in `AGENTS.md` and `WFL_PREVIEW.md` to enforce property-source traceability during entity refinement: always ask missing source, record source per property, and double-check property-to-source mapping with HPO before finalization.
- [2026-02-20 14:10:32 PST] Peter(PD): Timestamp correction for previous log entry; instruction-update event time aligned to system clock.
- [2026-02-20 14:18:38 PST] Peter(PD): Applied source-traceability rule to `Top3Case` in `data-model-top3-case-v0.6.md`: added property and relation source-check sections, recorded concrete source artifacts/fields, and flagged unresolved mappings for HPO confirmation (`pmOwnerId`, `ownedBy(PM)`, `closedAt`, `closureReason`).
- [2026-02-20 14:12:46 PST] Peter(PD): Timestamp correction for source-traceability update log entry; aligned with system clock.
- [2026-02-20 14:19:06 PST] Peter(PD): Created `data-model-top3-case-v0.7.md`; removed `Top3Case` derived rollup fields `lastActionAt`, `lastActionType`, and `actionCount` per HPO request; retained source-traceability sections and unresolved source-confirmation flags.
- [2026-02-20 14:20:54 PST] Peter(PD): Updated `data-model-top3-case-v0.7.md` with HPO-confirmed workaround: source `Top3Case.pmOwnerId` from Mantis `Assigned PM`, and aligned `Top3Case ownedBy Person(PM)` relation source note to the same workaround.
- [2026-02-20 14:27:03 PST] Peter(PD): Updated `data-model-top3-case-v0.7.md` with HPO-confirmed `closedAt` rule: infer from `BugNote.createdAt` when note headline is `--- Release ---` or `--- Close ---`; also expanded `BugNote.headlineType` enum to include `close`.
- [2026-02-20 14:32:10 PST] Peter(PD): Created `preview/bugnote-headlines.md` to define allowed BugNote headline options for structured note tagging.
- [2026-02-20 14:35:17 PST] Peter(PD): Updated `Top3Case.closedAt` source in `data-model-top3-case-v0.7.md` to reference `preview/bugnote-headlines.md` as the authoritative headline list for close inference.
- [2026-02-20 14:47:49 PST] Peter(PD): Added dual-format data model artifacts for discussion and implementation: `data-model-top3-case-v0.8.md` (entity-by-entity view) and `data-model-top3-case-graph-v0.8.yaml` (graph-creation-friendly nodes/edges/cardinality), aligned semantically with v0.7.
- [2026-02-20 14:54:38 PST] Peter(PD): Generated Mermaid graph artifact `data-model-top3-case-graph-v0.8.mmd` from graph YAML to support direct visualization in VS Code.
- [2026-02-20 14:59:12 PST] Peter(PD): Fixed Mermaid syntax in `data-model-top3-case-graph-v0.8.mmd` by replacing parser-sensitive edge-label characters (`*`, `|`, brackets) with safe tokens (`N`, `role_PM_or_Dev`, `x_to_y`).
- [2026-02-20 15:10:01 PST] Peter(PD): Naming convention update applied. Instruction in `WFL_PREVIEW.md` changed from `data-model-<mo>-<version>.md` to `data-model-<scope>-<version>.md`. From v0.8 onward, data model artifact names were switched to scope-based naming: `data-model-top3-workflow-v0.8.md`, `data-model-top3-workflow-graph-v0.8.yaml`, and `data-model-top3-workflow-graph-v0.8.mmd`.
