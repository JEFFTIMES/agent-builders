- Spark: Introduce an agent-maintained `TOP3 Case Profile` per case (PM notebook equivalent) to consolidate cross-system context.
- Spark Context: Sparked during Step 1 metric discussion while clarifying how to make Goal 2 (traceability) concrete and understandable.
- Notes: Keep this as a later-phase requirement candidate; during agent introduction, apply/write actions should remain PM confirmation-gated.

- Spark: Keep current linked bug-fix processing rule generic in UC-001; perform full deep-dive rule definition in UC-002 (TOP3 Bug Fixing) and validate again in Step 5 PRD review.
- Spark Context: Sparked during Step 2 (UC-001) while defining Step 2 review behavior for linked bug-fix requests.
- Notes: Reminder for PM and agent: when entering UC-002 interview and Step 5 refinement, explicitly interrogate inclusion/exclusion logic, triage thresholds, and reproducibility decision rules in detail.

- Spark: need a universal logging component to jot down pieces of information with tags during process the tasks.
- Spark Context: During the processing of a product design project, me and the HPO often need to jot down Q&A logs, spark ideas, summarized knowledge, prd_review logs, etc. Currently, they are scattered in different files and folders. It's better to consolidate the log-like messages in a single place for further reuse.
- Notes: Reminder for PM and agent: When refining the knowledge, discuss and update the agent accordingly.
