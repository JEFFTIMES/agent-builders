# Interview Guide Merge Checklist

Compare:
- Old: `working/agent-top3pm/interview/interview_guide.md`
- New: `working/agent-top3pm/interview/interview_guide.v2.md`

## Keep from Old Guide
- Warm-up brief content (business/system/problems/goals/metrics).
- Existing metric definitions and formulas.
- Opening protocol wording.

## Keep from New Guide
- Interaction-flow structure (what I tell / what I get / what I discuss).
- Evidence-capture logic by workflow step.
- Explicit closure and next-session handling.

## Merge Decisions to Make
1. Should warm-up brief stay in the same file or move to appendix?

move the worm-up brief into appendix to the guide.


2. Should question numbering be preserved from old guide or reset by flow sections?

I've manually merged the questions, in v3. Please review and comment. reset the numbering.


3. Should UC-001/UC-002 be separate files or one guide with variant sections?

in the same file: usecases.md


4. Which prompts are mandatory in every interview vs optional?

let's decide them one by one after the merge.
