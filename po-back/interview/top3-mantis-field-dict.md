# TOP3 Mantis Field Dictionary (1229978 Page)

Scope:

- Use-case: `UC-001` (TOP3 New Feature Request)
- Classification values: `Mandatory`, `Conditional`, `Optional`

Interpreting Rule Abstraction:
- `Identity-first`: use stable IDs (`TOP3 ID`, `NFR ID`, bug IDs, PMDB ID) as canonical cross-system anchors.
- `State-before-action`: interpret `Status`, ownership fields, and `ETA` before taking coordination/build actions.
- `Baseline-gating`: use `Earliest Build Number` as the reproduction baseline for linked bug inclusion.
- `Evidence-driven`: treat `Attached Files`, `Action History`, and `Bug Notes` as decision evidence, not optional commentary.
- `NFR compliance`: for NFR cases, missing `PMDB ID` is a compliance gap that triggers PM follow-up.
