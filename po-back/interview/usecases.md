# Use Cases - TOP3 PM

## Scope Note (Interview-Confirmed)
- Current interview path documents TOP3 `New Feature Request (NFR)` case flow first.
- A second, separate TOP3 `Bug Fixing` use case must be captured after NFR flow is completed.
- Do not merge both variants into a single flow; keep separate use-case entries for clarity and comparison.
